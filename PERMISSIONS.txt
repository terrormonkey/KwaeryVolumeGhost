Kwaery's Volume Control - Required Permissions
================================================

1. storage
   Saves your volume settings (global + per-domain) so they
   persist across browser restarts and PC reboots.

2. activeTab
   Allows the extension to interact with the page you're
   currently viewing when you click the extension icon.

3. tabs
   Lets the extension see all open tabs and their URLs so it
   can list domains in the Tab Volume Manager and broadcast
   volume changes to every tab at once.

4. scripting
   Enables injecting a small script into pages to directly
   set the volume on <audio> and <video> elements in real time.

5. host_permissions: <all_urls>
   Required so the extension can control media volume on any
   website, not just the active tab. Without this, per-domain
   volume and global cross-tab control would not work.
